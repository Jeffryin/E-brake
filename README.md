# Goal/Problem 
The goal of this project is to design a handbrake for my racing simulator setup without having to spend hundreds of dollars. To do this I devised a plan to get the basic electronic components to test the idea on a breadboard. The following electronic parts is as follows; Adafruit HX711 24-bit converter, Adafruit strain gauge load-cell, STM32 Nucleo Development Board, and more TBD. The first goal is to be able to get the ADC readings from the load-cell to the HX711 board to STM32 board. The next goal is to design a PCB board that will house all of the electronics and be powered through USB. The third goal is to design the physical handbrake to incorporate the PCB board in a possibly sleek design. 

These goals were made so I could improve my understanding of embedded C projects without using any supporting libraries and program everything using bit manipulation.
